# Real-Time Facial Expression Detection

This Python application uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to analyze facial expressions in real-time using your webcam. It identifies expressions such as **HAPPY**, **SAD**, **STRESSED**, **ANGRY**, **SURPRISED**, **SMILING**, and **NEUTRAL**.

## Features

‚úÖ Real-time video capture and face detection  
‚úÖ Facial landmarks detection with MediaPipe FaceMesh  
‚úÖ Expression analysis based on mouth, eyes, and eyebrow positions  
‚úÖ Visual overlays of landmarks and expression labels  

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

## Installation

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
````
2Ô∏è‚É£ Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
````


Usage
Run the application:
```bash
python your_script_name.py
(Replace your_script_name.py with your actual Python file name, e.g. expression_analyzer.py)
````

üìù Controls:

Press q to exit the application.

## How it works

- The webcam feed is processed in real-time
- MediaPipe detects facial landmarks
- Distances between key facial points (mouth, eyes, eyebrows) are measured
- Expressions are classified based on these measurements and displayed on the video
